# Coursera problems 

C++ code samples are taken from my programming assignments in Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization ([link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)).

Each file contains short problem description on the top. Problems show implementations of:
- splay tree
- suffix array
- suffix tree
